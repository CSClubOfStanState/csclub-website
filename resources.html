              <strong>two</strong> resume templates that are pretty nice to
              have. <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-left"></i> Please make sure your

              Students that are interested in being proactive about their own
              career but are not too interested in Software Engineering while
              find this guide worthwhile. The guide supplements the 4-Year Guide
              to SWE at Stan State, but on it's own, can be a powerful resource
              for students to acquaint themselves with developing their personal
              brand.
